This project sampling is work that I've made in a little over a week during full time college.  This code is a small part of a personal project of mine(the one described in my resume).  And I've done all the programming and development for this part.

Specifically what the project sampling code does, is function as a rough database management system and display, using python, a little pygame, and text files.  Specifically it is made to load and write data on user profiles, and display them with a fisheye slider that can be rotated by clicking.
I created this system because I wanted a very simple way of storing data on files with python that could be optimally used with this game, and I was unsatisfied with what I had found for python's main ways of file writing with similar systems.
For this sampling of the project I've stripped out the rest of the game and user interface.  Specifically the code I wrote was profile_loader.py and title_screen.py though to be honest I started drafting the profile loader before I turned my attention to it during that week, but it's been reworked and changed drastically.  Though it's not entirely done in this sampling, mainly there's a slight visual bug when selecting to the right, and on the back-end the very next thing to do is add the way to expand the file for adding more profiles.  If you want to see the program as it runs, run main.py with python and pygame installed.
